#  Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development stages for creating a **Misinterpretation-Free Conversational AI**, along with additional modules such as IME improvement, multilingual translation support, safety detection, and daily-use AI utilities.

The project evolves in clear multi-stage phases to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and global contribution.

---

##  Phase 1 — Core Misinterpretation-Free Engine (Current Phase)
**Goal:** Build the foundational logic that prevents misunderstanding in human–AI communication.

### Tasks
- Design rule-based + probabilistic interpretation filters  
- Implement contextual disambiguation  
- Create conversation-state tracking  
- Publish baseline implementation  
- Open API specification

**Status:**  In progress

---

##  Phase 2 — Multilingual Expansion
**Goal:** Extend the engine to support multilingual scenarios and cross-lingual ambiguity detection.

### Tasks
- English ↔ Japanese accuracy optimization  
- Add support for additional languages  
- Introduce language-agnostic meaning representation  
- Improve translation reliability using context-preservation rules

**Status:** Planned

---

##  Phase 3 — Input System Integration (IME Module)
**Goal:** Reduce misinterpretation starting at the *input layer*.

### Tasks
- Intelligent IME prediction aligned with context  
- Prevent harmful or unintended conversions  
- Support for multilingual typing environments  
- Provide developer API for integration

**Status:** Planned

---

##  Phase 4 — Safety, Fraud, and Abuse Detection
**Goal:** Build models that detect:
- online harassment,  
- misinformation,  
- fraud patterns,  
- social engineering attempts,  
- malicious rewriting.

### Tasks
- Real-time detection engine  
- Browser/SNS extension prototypes  
- Developer package release  
- Public dataset and benchmarks

**Status:** Planned

---

##  Phase 5 — Daily Utility AI Integration
**Goal:** Integrate the core engine into daily-use applications.

### Modules
- Smart error-proof chatbot  
- Enhanced translation assistant  
- Personal safety helper (e.g., emergency context extraction)  
- Productivity tools (summaries, rewriting, Q&A)  
- Optional integration with home devices

**Status:** Planned

---

##  Phase 6 — Community & Open Development
**Goal:** Encourage global contributors to participate.

### Tasks
- Add contribution guidelines  
- Publish development API docs  
- Release sample apps  
- Provide issue templates, discussion boards  
- Add multilingual documentation (EN/JP first)

**Status:** Planned

---

## ✔ Vision
A conversational AI ecosystem where:
- users cannot be misunderstood,  
- meaning is preserved across languages,  
- safety is proactively ensured,  
- developers can freely build on the base engine,  
- and the technology benefits everyday life globally.
