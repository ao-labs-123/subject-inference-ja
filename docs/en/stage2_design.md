Note:
The clarification performed at this stage is not intended to advance semantic inference,
but rather to prevent premature commitment to an incorrect interpretation.

Detailed causal reasoning and syntactic analysis are handled in later stages.

Stage 2: Clarification-Based Prevention of Misinterpretation

◇Overview
In this stage, when the subject of a sentence is omitted and cannot be uniquely identified from context,
the AI refrains from making assumptions and instead asks clarifying questions.

◇Problem
Conventional dialogue AI systems often infer a subject with high probability even when contextual information is insufficient,
leading to frequent misinterpretations.

◇Approach
	•	Defer interpretation when contextual certainty is low
	•	Generate clarification questions when multiple subject candidates exist
	•	Prioritize confirmation over probabilistic inference

◇Example
User input:

“Yesterday was really tough.”

AI response:

“Are you referring to something that happened to you personally?”

◇Expected Benefits
	•	Significant reduction of misinterpretation
	•	More faithful understanding of user intent
	•	Applicability to high-stakes domains such as healthcare, legal consultation, and fraud prevention
