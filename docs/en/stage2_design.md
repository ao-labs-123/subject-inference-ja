Note:
The clarification performed at this stage is not intended to advance semantic inference,
but rather to prevent premature commitment to an incorrect interpretation.

Detailed causal reasoning and syntactic analysis are handled in later stages.

Stage 2: Clarification-Based Prevention of Misinterpretation

## Overview
In this stage, when the subject of a sentence is omitted and cannot be uniquely identified from context,
the AI refrains from making assumptions and instead asks clarifying questions.

## Problem
Conventional dialogue AI systems often infer a subject with high probability even when contextual information is insufficient,
leading to frequent misinterpretations.

## Approach
	•	Defer interpretation when contextual certainty is low
	•	Generate clarification questions when multiple subject candidates exist
	•	Prioritize confirmation over probabilistic inference

## Example
User input:

“Yesterday was really tough.”

AI response:

“Are you referring to something that happened to you personally?”

## Expected Benefits
	•	Significant reduction of misinterpretation
	•	More faithful understanding of user intent
	•	Applicability to high-stakes domains such as healthcare, legal consultation, and fraud prevention


Reference Implementation (Python)

## Overview

This module implements Stage 2, which prevents premature interpretation when a sentence contains an omitted or ambiguous subject.

Instead of inferring the most likely meaning, the system:
	•	detects ambiguity,
	•	defers interpretation,
	•	and asks a minimal clarification question.

⸻

## Core Concepts
	•	No guessing: probabilistic inference is suppressed at this stage
	•	Ambiguity-aware: multiple subject candidates are preserved
	•	Confirmation-first: user clarification is required before advancing

## Design Notes
	•	This implementation does not resolve meaning
	•	It does not perform causal or syntactic analysis
	•	It only determines whether interpretation is safe to proceed

## Later stages are responsible for:
	•	causal reasoning
	•	modifier attachment
	•	semantic role inference

⸻

## Extensibility

This stage can be extended to:
	•	speech-to-text systems
	•	TTS read-aloud disambiguation
	•	safety-critical conversational agents

⸻

## Explicit Non-Goals
	•	Maximizing recall via guessing
	•	Statistical subject selection
	•	Confidence-based inference

⸻

## License Notice

This reference implementation is designed for:
	•	research
	•	education
	•	safety-oriented system design

Commercial usage should consider downstream responsibility handling.

⸻

このコードは 「実用最小構成」 です。
	•	NLP 部分は意図的に未完成
	•	重要なのは「推測しない制御フロー」
	•	精度ではなく 誤読しない設計 を示すための実装
