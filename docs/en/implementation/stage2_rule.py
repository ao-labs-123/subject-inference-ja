#Implementation Notes – Stage 2

##Purpose

This implementation corresponds to Stage 2: Clarification-Based Prevention of Misinterpretation.

The goal of this stage is not to advance semantic or causal inference, but to prevent the AI from prematurely committing to an incorrect interpretation when contextual certainty is insufficient.

This module explicitly prioritizes confirmation over probabilistic inference.

##Design Principles
	1.	Interpretation Deferral
When the subject of a sentence is omitted or ambiguous, the system refrains from selecting the most probable interpretation.
	2.	Ambiguity Detection Before Inference
If multiple plausible subject candidates exist, interpretation is suspended until clarification is obtained.
	3.	Minimal Clarification
Clarification questions are generated only when necessary and are limited to confirming the subject or reference scope.
	4.	No Semantic Advancement at This Stage
This stage does not perform:
	•	causal reasoning
	•	modifier attachment resolution
	•	semantic role labeling
These processes are intentionally deferred to later stages.

##Processing Flow
	1.	Analyze input for subject omission or ambiguity
	2.	Evaluate whether the subject can be uniquely determined from context
	3.	If not:
	•	retain multiple candidate interpretations
	•	generate a clarification question
	4.	Await user confirmation before passing the input to the next stage

##Example

User Input
Yesterday was really tough.

System Response
Are you referring to something that happened to you personally?

##Expected Benefits
	•	Significant reduction of misinterpretation
	•	Improved faithfulness to user intent
	•	Applicability to high-stakes domains such as:
	•	healthcare
	•	legal consultation
	•	fraud prevention

##Scope Limitation

This implementation intentionally avoids heuristic guessing, even when statistical likelihood appears high.

Accuracy is defined as correctness after confirmation, not prediction confidence.
