Overview
Stage 3 enables the dialogue AI to interpret sentences and utterances not merely as sequences of words, but as chains of causal relationships.
This implementation forms the foundation for reducing misinterpretation by explicitly modeling cause-and-effect reasoning.

⸻

Objectives
	•	Infer cause → effect relationships within context
	•	Improve judgment accuracy and clarification strategies
	•	Provide a reusable reasoning layer for multiple AI domains

⸻

Processing Flow (Conceptual)
	1.	Event Extraction
	•	Identify events, actions, and states from input
	•	e.g., “was running”, “fell down”, “it was raining”
	2.	Temporal Ordering
	•	Arrange events along a timeline
	•	Detect simultaneity and precedence
	3.	Causal Candidate Generation
	•	Generate hypotheses such as “A may have caused B”
	•	Maintain implicit causal possibilities
	4.	Causality Validation
	•	Evaluate physical and logical plausibility
	•	Mark uncertain relations as non-deterministic
	5.	Confidence-Aware Output
	•	Output causal links with confidence scores
	•	Pass results to subsequent stages (modifier analysis, clarification)

Key Characteristics
	•	Non-deterministic by design
→ Prevents premature conclusions
	•	Enables structural reasoning without full reliance on deep learning
	•	Applicable to text, speech, and sensor-based inputs

⸻

Potential Applications
	•	Misinterpretation-resistant dialogue systems
	•	Surveillance and safety monitoring AI
	•	Scam and impersonation detection
	•	Context-aware speech synthesis
	•	AR-based situational explanation systems
