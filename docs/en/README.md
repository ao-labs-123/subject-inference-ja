# Subject Inference for Japanese (WIP)
A research project to reduce AI misinterpretation caused by Japanese subject omission.

This project aims to reduce AI misinterpretation caused by subject omission in Japanese.
It provides logic-based rules to help language models infer omitted subjects more accurately.

### 📄 Documentation
- [Stage 1 — Design (English)](docs/en/stage1_design.md)
- [Stage 2 — Design (English)](docs/en/stage2_design.md)
- [Stage 3 — Design (English)](docs/en/stage3_design.md)
- Stage 4–5: Coming soon

## Improvement Stages
- Stage 1: Speaker Identification (First-Person Omission)
- Stage 2: Clarification-Based Misinterpretation Prevention
　Stage 2 prevents misinterpretation by deferring inference and requesting clarification.
- Stage 3: Contextual and Causal Inference

# Subject Inference – Stage 2

## Overview (EN)
This repository presents a clarification-based mechanism designed to
prevent premature commitment to incorrect interpretations in dialogue AI.
Stage 2 focuses on ambiguity detection and minimal clarification,
not semantic inference.

## Status
