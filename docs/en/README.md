##　Project Title

A Contextual and Structural Approach to Misinterpretation Reduction in Conversational AI

⸻

##　Background

Most existing conversational AI systems rely heavily on morphological analysis and statistical methods.
While effective for surface-level accuracy, these approaches often fail to capture
sentence structure, causal relationships, and modifier dependencies, leading to misinterpretation.

This limitation affects not only conversational AI, but also machine translation, IME, OCR, and speech systems.

⸻

##　Objective

This project aims to propose and implement an approach that enables AI systems to
understand sentences as structured meanings rather than isolated tokens,
thereby reducing misinterpretation in human-AI interaction.

⸻

##　Approach

The system adopts a staged improvement model, including:
	•	Clarification of contextual assumptions
	•	Minimal and strategic clarification questions
	•	Causal relationship inference
	•	Structural and grammatical dependency analysis
	•	Final intent determination

This approach complements traditional NLP techniques while improving
semantic and grammatical understanding.

##　Scope / Limitation

Scope
	•	Conversational AI misinterpretation reduction
	•	Potential applications in MT, IME, OCR, and speech systems

Limitation
	•	Not intended for legal or ethical final judgments
	•	Designed to assist, not replace, human decision-making

⸻

##　Example Use Cases
	•	Improved clarification in conversational AI
	•	Scam and phishing attempt mitigation
	•	Reduced semantic drift in machine translation
	•	Context-aware IME and speech input
